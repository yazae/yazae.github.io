## Fantasy
Pourquoi lire de la fantasy quand on peut lire de la fantasy queer ? :3

### Les Faucons de Raverra
**Les Faucons de Raverra**, Melissa Caruso
CW/th√®mes‚ÄØ: lesbian, gay, bi mc and sc, absolutely no homophobia, gay parents. One genderqueer sc in book 3.

  >  What can I say, I love a story with two women as protagonists, one who is a fiery badass, the other very smart and bred for politics, who admits she doesn‚Äôt like that world and explains her ethical struggles. Plus danger, adventure, beautiful romance. (Azaliz)


### Legendborn
**Legendborn**, de Tracy Deonn. Langue : anglais.  
CW/th√®mes‚ÄØ: Urban Fantasy.

<img src="../assets/img/PAL/legendborn_cover.jpg" alt="Legendborn cover" width="50%"/>

> The main characters in Legendborn aren‚Äôt LGBT (well, there‚Äôs a thing but I‚Äôm not going to say anything because spoilers, darling) but a good many of the characters surrounding them are. And while there have been reams of Round Table slash fic written through the ages, what I appreciated most about the way Deonn included LGBT content is that she simply‚Ä¶included it. The Scions in Legendborn may be interacting with extremely conservative and traditional personalities from long ago, and while those personalities certainly have some traction in terms of control, neither the Scions nor the other members of their courts are about to get steamrolled by outdated mores and cultural hangups where sexuality and gender identity are concerned. Alas, some of them aren‚Äôt as progressive about race, but that‚Äôs a different post.

### White Trash Warlock
**White Trash Warlock** de David R. Slayton. Langue : anglais.  
CW/th√®mes‚ÄØ: Urban Fantasy.

<img src="../assets/img/PAL/white-trash-warlock_cover.jpg" alt="White Trash Warlock cover" width="50%"/>

> Adam Binder‚Äôs family would rather have him involuntarily committed to a mental health facility than believe in his magical abilities. They aren‚Äôt all that much more accepting about the fact Adam is gay. Adam is pretty sure that‚Äôs just the way it is.
>
> He‚Äôs proven wrong, however, when he meets Vic, a police officer who becomes accidentally embroiled in Adam‚Äôs efforts to thwart the eldritch horror hovering over Denver. Vic hasn‚Äôt considered the fact he might be bi, before but finds himself attracted to Adam and without any drama whatsoever, thinks: ah. Okay. Bi. Cool. His family meets Adam and thinks, What a sweetheart. Glad Vic found him. Sum total. That‚Äôs not to say the two men figuring one another out and navigating a potential relationship is simple or without nuance; it means they can continue their efforts to prevent the apocalypse while they do it.

### Cemetery Boys
**Cemetery Boys** de Aiden Thomas. Langue : anglais.  
CW/th√®mes‚ÄØ: Urban Fantasy.

<img src="../assets/img/PAL/cemetery-boys_cover.jpg" alt="Cemetery Boys cover" width="50%"/>

> One of the things I loved most about this LGBT urban fantasy is the fact that while Yadriel‚Äôs family may have difficulties accepting the fact he‚Äôs trans, his deity never does (not a spoiler, it‚Äôs in the first chapter). While that might not be enough for Yadriel, it does help him believe he deserves his place in the world and grant him the confidence he needs for his journey.
>
> I also adore Julian‚Äôs deep acceptance of the fact he‚Äôs gay; it‚Äôs not something we see in bad boy, macho characters on the regular and it‚Äôs so damn special, both as a reader who didn‚Äôt insist on her parents working to understand ‚Äúbi‚Äù and later ‚Äúpan‚Äù because she was just too tired of being judged, and as a parent who wants her kids to know they can be anything and anyone they damn want.

### Testament T01 - L'H√©riti√®re  
**Testament T01 - L'H√©riti√®re**, de Jeanne-A. Debats. Langue : fran√ßais.  
CW/th√®mes‚ÄØ:  Urban Fantasy

<img src="../assets/img/PAL/testament-T1_cover.jpg" alt="Couverture de Testament T01 - l'H√©riti√®re" width="50%"/>


> Je m'appelle Agn√®s Cleyre et je suis orpheline. De ma m√®re sorci√®re, j'ai h√©rit√© du don de voir les fant√¥mes. Plut√¥t une mal√©diction qui m'a oblig√©e √† vivre recluse, √† l'abri de la violence des sentiments des morts. Mais depuis le jour o√π mon oncle notaire m'a prise sous son aile, ma vie a chang√©. Contrairement aux apparences, le quotidien de l'√©tude qu'il dirige n'est pas de tout repos : vampires, loups-garous, sir√®nes... A croire que tout l'Alter Monde a une succession √† g√©rer ! Moi qui voulais de l'action, je ne suis pas d√©√ßue... Et le beau Navarre n'y est peut-√™tre pas √©tranger.

## SF  

### Spellhacker  
**Spellhacker**, de MK England. Langue : anglais.  
CW/th√®mes‚ÄØ: nb mc, mc with chronic illness, queer mc  

<img src="../assets/img/PAL/spellhacker.jpg" alt="Spellhacker cover" width="50%"/>

  >  set in a world with tech and magic, really really cool, one of the main character is non binary and has a chronic illness <3 There are a few annoying thing in this book plot wise as the author is at the very beginning of her career I think and I wish it would have gone through a few more rounds of editing but overall I really loved it!!! (Loke)

  > Can only agree with Loke! The universe is really really cool, it‚Äôs sort of a dystopia with magic that can be used either organically or via technology, and it‚Äôs fascinating! I‚Äôve got a big beef with the mc who‚Äôs always angry at her friends with no reason, but the overal book felt like a good heist movie. (Azaliz)
