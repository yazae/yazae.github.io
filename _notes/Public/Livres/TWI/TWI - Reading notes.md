Hi !
I will try to keep reading notes of my readings of The Wandering Inn, some times just for a joke or to express why it's so good, other times to ramble about thoeries, it's a looong webnovel who update very often, so it will makes a lot of posts.
It *may* have spoilers, but, honestly, if it's the first time you read about this series, you are so far from me that, it's safe, in a sense, you won't remember/understand before you caught up. (anyways, will specify the spoilers).

## Volume 8

### Interlude : Perspective and Past (09/10/21)
Ghosts of the past - after 8.46G

**Background**  
(background spoilers)

So, this chapter is an Interlude. In TWI, this means a break in the main timelines, with focus on a side characters/or, often too, glimpses of stories from differents characters we know, around a theme.

The chapter start in the lands of the dead, and focus on ghosts of the past. It's very interesting, because we know very little of the metaphisic of this world, of it's huuuuge history, because we have the knowledge of mortals who live right now, on this era, where there is very few immortals left, and this civilisation have a memory of a few thousand of years, at most, which is not enough.

We know very little about the era of Giant and Dragons, even less about Elves and Gnomes (who appears to have vanished), but we know that, at some time, they were Gods in this world, and now they are dead (and one probably 'sleeping').

But, how? When? Do they have build this world or the world's system (levels & and classes)? If not, who? We are at Volume 8, and there is still so much questions!

So, to help little with these mysteries, we get some historical facts in this chapter :

> What made even Merindue hesitate was‚Ä¶it sounded like Nerrhavia was serious. And yet‚Äîyes, remember the tyrant. Remember her acts and evil that led them to denounce her, and celebrate her demise.
>
> Also remember she was devious enough to rule an empire for nearly a thousand years, and that she did not want to die twice.

Nerrhavia is a ghost, former queen of a country of Stitch Folks. In the world today, we know of a country of Stitch Folks : Nerrhavia's Fallen. So, she ruled it for about 1000 years, and her death, caused by Merindue (?), even changed the name of the country to celebrate her fall.

We learn later the secret of her longevity:

> Draining ten thousand men of life the hard way?

It's very possible that she was a vampire, but maybe not ? ü§î

We know in chap 6.14K that her reign ended 600 years ago, so she reigned between -600 and -1600~.

- Another discovery of this chapter :

A ghost general , Ignoyeithe, talking about the dead gods :

> Now consider their _nature_. They are all anathema. I have felt such revulsion only a few times. I do not know the ‚ÄòCrelers‚Äô which came after me; but the Soulless of Rhir? The things that come from beyond, that Drath hunts? And‚Ä¶A‚Äôctelios Salash itself.  
> These all provoke the same universal hatred in my being. Do you understand?

So, it's very interesting because a link is made between all these beings : the fact that everyone perceives them as 'anathema', something to destroy at all cost, because they _aren't of this world_. We also learn several things :

- The general don't know the Crelers, some monstruous foe who appeared in Rhir around -6000, and caused a global war of 800 years. So, he lived before - 6000.

- Before the Crelers were the Soulless of Rhir, another big enemy who come from Rhir's depht. We know that there is a dead god in Rhir who made the Crelers and the Soulless and many other horrors, while sleeping.

- Drath, a mysterious island we don't really know yet, fight 'things' from 'beyond'. From memory, Drath is close to the 'end of the world', a fall without end who circle the world of TWI, so I guess that 'beyound' means 'from the end of the world'.

- A'ctelios is a giant dead being who have fallen eons ago. It has apparently come from 'beyond the end of the world' too. Today, it's head is conolized by humans, who carve through it's immortal flesh to build their city. The problem : it begin to regain some kind of life through the millennia, and regularly must be 'stopped' from awakening (even with a carved head).

So, we can guess that all these beings are linked together, being considered as 'gods' or creation of 'gods', and they are all perceived as 'anathema'. They also are outsiders of this world, maybe invaders, they seems to want to prey on the living, or to take revenge? Mysteries.

### 8.50 (03/11/21)
<subtitle>After 8.49M (Mrsha and the Meeting of tribes) - Background spoilers</subtitle>

So, this chapter is starting with Pelt, a (very) grumpy and (relatively) old dwarf. He manage to get the Demas metal from the Meeting of tribes, and : amazing, he didn't know this metal at all!!  
He is a master of his craft, one of the best smith of the whole world, he have to be at least 300 years old and comes from the best forges of his kind, so, if he didn't knew this metal, it is the same as saying that the metal was created, invented by a master.

He recon that it's a feat of a lifetime for any [Smith] or [Melter], but say an interesting thing :

> So it‚Äôs been made before. If it was a metal like Naq-Alrama steel. If it was a metal made out of meteorites and Adamantium. If an [Archmage] helped discover it, and it came shooting out of legends, rare ores never seen under the light of the sun‚Äîwhenever a [Smith] makes it, they‚Äôre geniuses and damned lucky and it‚Äôll be a grand thing. But they always, always _rediscovered_ it. Understand?

> ‚ÄúNo. The greatest smiths to ever walk this world made every metal conceivable. And you can laugh. You can think I‚Äôm talking on forge-fumes. But I am not wrong. I could take this dagger, and if I went to‚Ä¶I would be able to come back and tell you exactly what it does, how it‚Äôs made, and why it‚Äôs a piece of worthless metal because it was forged so poorly, and smelted with no understanding of it.‚Äù
>
> Pelt lifted the dagger. He looked at Emessa and the apprentice saw it in his gaze. The Dwarf turned away.
>
> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me. Just know, apprentice. You‚Äôre young.‚Äù

Sooooo, a mysterious being, a people (?), very probably immortal, but _not_ the Dragons : it left the Elves and the Gnomes, or another species I don't know. The Elves have vanished, and it's the gnomes who were known to be the crafter among the other immortals.

But.... Pelt knew them ??? Did he met them in his lifetime?!  
Even Teriarch, our favorite dragon, talk about them as a people of the past, from several millenia ago, at the very least.

Maybe a gnome is hiding in the mountains of the dwarfs?? Does the dwarfs are coming from the gnomes like Pelt could be hinting (when saying that dwarves were not that short, at least _today_)? Like the Drakes and the Dragons, the Lizarfolk and the Wyrms?


### Chapter 8.60 (26/12/21)
The Chatroom - Big spoilers when said.

Utterly hilarious, it takes place mainly in a magical chat, where all the people interested in Erin's cure are being gathered.

We have monarchs of several kingdoms, a Great Sage, archmages, famous alchemists, lyonette, Mrsha, Ryoka, a Necromancer, several members of the Horns, a grand revenant Vizir, all of them talking together, picking fight, exchanging news, and at first it's totally unreadable because there is too much people in the chat, with a lot of random pseudonyms ^^

It's basically all the main storylines of Volume 8 who comes together in one chat, and it's very rewarding in this matter.

It takes some time for them to divide in sub chats by subject, and actually begin to pool knowledge, not without some battle of ego between mortals and immortals, all of them great in their fields and yet unable to find a solution by themselves. Ceria (IceSquirrel ) introduce some knowledge about cooling flesh from her Cryo-master, the Goblin Witch and alchemist I talk about ghost antidote.

The necromancer and Khelt talk about the damage made to the body while de-freezing someone (Erin discover then that actual people were used for experiment by Khelt)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Big spoiler starting now ‚ö†Ô∏è**

All in all, everyone make progress, and some characters enter the field unprompted, Belavierr make a scene when discovering Mrsha, calling her her nemesis in the chat, Geneva (the doctor) appear to give a solution to a missing piece of the problem, and, last but not least, Nier enter the field with his ghost mushroom from recently befriended goblins, and resolve one of the main issue with his habitual class.

The pace of the story and of this quest is quickening, in such ways that we actually could see Erin's resurrection at the end of Vol 8, in... a few months? :O

After that, I believe that we will begin the last arc of the story, the battle against the gods... we shall see!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Big spoiler ending ‚ö†Ô∏è**

What a trip <3

### Interlude - Satar (20/02/22)
The Writer - After 8.65 and the Hectval war interlude - Background spoilers

This chapter is really funny, like every chapter with self-insert in it : it‚Äôs about a [Writer], and you KNOW that the skills Satar is getting (let‚Äôs say, like, [Anti-Cramping Muscles]) would _really_ be useful for the writer of this very story :‚Äô‚Äô)

But it‚Äôs not only funny, it‚Äôs getting more and more intense, Satar is reaching some BIG secret with her skill [Narrative: Spot Inconsistencies], and it‚Äôs such a good use of a skill, it‚Äôs awesome, everything PA touch turn to **magic** and it‚Äôs yet another example of that :3

I will continue to read but, just, AAAAAAHHH it‚Äôs so cool !!!!!!!!!!!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  

>‚ÄúWhat is it? A new Skill about the past?‚Äù  
> [‚Ä¶]
>
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶[Seal of Veracity].‚Äù  
> [‚Ä¶]  
> _Seal? So cool! Can you show me?_
>
> Mrsha danced about excitedly, looking away from her [Message] scroll and penpal. Obligingly, Satar reached out and drew‚Ä¶a magical stamp out of the air. Mrsha went cross eyed, and Satar pressed it into Mrsha‚Äôs forehead.
>
> The magical stamper glowed and vanished, leaving a little, glowing stamp on Mrsha‚Äôs forehead.  
> [‚Ä¶]
>
> ‚ÄúIt lasts as long as it‚Äôs true, Mri. I think it changes color if it‚Äôs less true. Go on! Try it!‚Äù
>
> Mrsha frowned. Then she wrote, carefully, and held up a notecard for all to see.
>
> _I am always a good girl._
>
> **Instantly, the seal glowing a gentle green-blue, and even slightly changing to hues of yellow or purple‚Äîturned red, burst into flames, and fell off Mrsha‚Äôs forehead.**  
> The girl stared down at it.

I‚Äôm _dying_

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
few, what a ride... again!! I love this series so muchüíúüíúüíú

## Volume 9
### 9.00 (23/07/22)
Quests

> "Erin is back. Yay, yay. I wonder what will explode first?‚Äù

> "Did you see that smile? Your Ancestors, it‚Äôs happening"
>
> "Alright. I‚Äôm confirming with Zevara, and I‚Äôll send a copy of the [Message] to the Council. The betting pool wins‚Äîten days! Did she say where she was going?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶Adventurer‚Äôs Guild. A ‚Äòlittle errand‚Äô.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúDead gods have mercy on them.‚Äù

It would be funny if nothing were happening, with everyone overreacting :')  
But the truth is that they are all underreacting, you can't control the Solstice Effect TM :3


> ‚ÄúPatrol 1 is in place, Watch Captain. Solstice Contingency active.‚Äù

One of the funniest line so far :''''')

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
It's a very good introducing chapter for the volume 9, with crazy Erin sheningans, a lot of fun, and some plot too, TWI is back and it will be good and magic as promised :3
