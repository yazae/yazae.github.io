Vous trouverez ici ma PAL(pile à lire) non-exhaustive, principalement remplie de bouquins queer 📚  

J’essaierais d’écrire une critique dans [[Les micro-critiques de Yazae (livres)]] quand j’aurais terminé l’un deux !

## Queer Urban Fantasy
Pourquoi lire de l’Urban Fantasy quand on peut lire de l’Urban Fantasy queer ? :3

### Legendborn
**Legendborn**, de Tracy Deonn. Langue : anglais.  
CW/thèmes : Urban Fantasy.

> The main characters in Legendborn aren’t LGBT (well, there’s a thing but I’m not going to say anything because spoilers, darling) but a good many of the characters surrounding them are. And while there have been reams of Round Table slash fic written through the ages, what I appreciated most about the way Deonn included LGBT content is that she simply…included it. The Scions in Legendborn may be interacting with extremely conservative and traditional personalities from long ago, and while those personalities certainly have some traction in terms of control, neither the Scions nor the other members of their courts are about to get steamrolled by outdated mores and cultural hangups where sexuality and gender identity are concerned. Alas, some of them aren’t as progressive about race, but that’s a different post.


### Mooncakes
**Mooncakes** de Suzanne Walker & Wendy Xu.  Langue : anglais.  
CW/thèmes : Urban Fantasy, Witch.

<img src="../assets/img/PAL/mooncakes_cover.jpg" alt="Mooncakes cover" width="50%"/>

> Nova Huang is a teenage witch. She lives with her grandmother and her grandmother’s wife and helps them run their occult bookshop. Which may be why she can’t help investigating rumors of a white wolf into the woods one night, where she’s surprised to find her old crush Tam Lang, in werewolf form, battling a demon horse. They ask Nova and her grandmothers for help, and who are witches to say no?
>
> Of course, working together means spending time together and spending time together means remembering why they were drawn to one another so many years ago. The mission comes first of course; there’s a town that needs saving. But you can’t fight every second of the day, now can you?


### White Trash Warlock
**White Trash Warlock** de David R. Slayton. Langue : anglais.  
CW/thèmes : Urban Fantasy.

<img src="../assets/img/PAL/white-trash-warlock_cover.jpg" alt="White Trash Warlock cover" width="50%"/>

> Adam Binder’s family would rather have him involuntarily committed to a mental health facility than believe in his magical abilities. They aren’t all that much more accepting about the fact Adam is gay. Adam is pretty sure that’s just the way it is.
>
> He’s proven wrong, however, when he meets Vic, a police officer who becomes accidentally embroiled in Adam’s efforts to thwart the eldritch horror hovering over Denver. Vic hasn’t considered the fact he might be bi, before but finds himself attracted to Adam and without any drama whatsoever, thinks: ah. Okay. Bi. Cool. His family meets Adam and thinks, What a sweetheart. Glad Vic found him. Sum total. That’s not to say the two men figuring one another out and navigating a potential relationship is simple or without nuance; it means they can continue their efforts to prevent the apocalypse while they do it.

### Cemetery Boys
**Cemetery Boys** de Aiden Thomas. Langue : anglais.  
CW/thèmes : Urban Fantasy.

<img src="../assets/img/PAL/cemetery-boys_cover.jpg" alt="Cemetery Boys cover" width="50%"/>

> One of the things I loved most about this LGBT urban fantasy is the fact that while Yadriel’s family may have difficulties accepting the fact he’s trans, his deity never does (not a spoiler, it’s in the first chapter). While that might not be enough for Yadriel, it does help him believe he deserves his place in the world and grant him the confidence he needs for his journey.
>
> I also adore Julian’s deep acceptance of the fact he’s gay; it’s not something we see in bad boy, macho characters on the regular and it’s so damn special, both as a reader who didn’t insist on her parents working to understand “bi” and later “pan” because she was just too tired of being judged, and as a parent who wants her kids to know they can be anything and anyone they damn want.
